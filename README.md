# BoardGameGeek for Android
This is an unofficial BoardGameGeek application for Android.

This app searches and syncs data from BoardGameGeek.com. It's not a game itself - it's a reference tool that provides information about board games.

See what's changed in the [Change Log](/CHANGELOG.md).

See what we're planning for on our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/pRZWIOOv).

The installer is available through the Play Store. If you are interested in Beta (or maybe even Alpha releases), please join the [Google+ Community](https://plus.google.com/communities/109617005048169697217), or opt in at the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.boardgamegeek).
